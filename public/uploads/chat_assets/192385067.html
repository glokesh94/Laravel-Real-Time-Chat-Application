        <p>Dear <span class="cap">Lokesh</span>,</p>

        <p>If you’ve made it here, then congratulations! Because this 
means that your archetype is the Explorer! But what does this actually 
mean? Don’t worry, everything you need to know will be on this page. 
Stick to the end of it and I promise that you’ll experience something 
truly magical.</p>

        <p>The Archetypal Identifier that you’ve recently used is 
designed to help you uncover your personality profile... Or, what we 
also know as your archetype - an in-depth examination of your entire 
being...</p>

        <!--Insert Archetypal Wheel Image-->
        <img class="img-intext" src="Individualogist.com%20|%20Reading_files/archetype-wheel.png">

        <p>Your tendencies, your strengths, your weaknesses, and your innate personality traits.</p>

        <p>You must have guessed it by now, <span class="cap">Lokesh</span>...</p>

        <p>Yes, you can use this information to make astronomical changes in your life!</p>

        <p>You can use it to leverage on your strengths to attain your goals and ambitions...</p>

        <p>You can use it to identify and re-construct your weaknesses...</p>

        <p>And of course, you can use it to embark on the life that you've always dreamed of...</p>

        <p>But before we get into that, I want to share with you a little bit about your archetype, The Explorer, and what it means...</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header"><span class="cap">Lokesh</span>, You Are The Explorer - And This Is What It Means...</h2>

        <p><span class="cap">Lokesh</span>, your archetype suggests that
 you're an adventurer of sorts... A worldly, wandering traveller who 
belongs to no land. You're constantly on the move, and always seeking 
exciting thrills that are far beyond your comfort zone... And yet, 
ironically, that's where you feel the most comfortable.</p>

        <p>Yes, <span class="cap">Lokesh</span>... You're a curious, and
 adventurous individual looking to make your mark on the world. You want
 to experience everything that the world has to offer - its magnificent 
lands, its foreign cultures, and its exciting opportunities.</p>

        <p>Based on your archetype, <span class="cap">Lokesh</span>, 
your biggest value in life is your sense of freedom. That's because as 
an Explorer, you're highly energetic, and you're always on the move. You
 tend to get bored with mundane and monotonus routines - and you're 
always looking for a way out.</p>

        <p>While others struggle to feel comfortable in unfamiliar 
places, you just seem to feel at home in the most distant of lands. 
That’s because you envision the world as a singular place – and you 
understand that each and everyone of us belong to the same home.</p>

        <!--Insert Archetype Icon-->
        <img class="img-intext" src="Individualogist.com%20|%20Reading_files/explorer.png">

        <p>...Your archetype also suggests that you have the tendency to take action before thinking, <span class="cap">Lokesh</span>... But that does not mean to say that you're thoughtless - in fact, it's quite the contrary. You see, <span class="cap">Lokesh</span>, you recognize that thoughts tend to stand in the way of action. And what matters to you, is action.</p>

        <p>You're an excellent communicator by nature, <span class="cap">Lokesh</span>...
 Your travels and curiosity has equipped you with a repertoire of 
captivating stories - stories that people absolutely love to hear. 
You're often the center of attention - regardless whether you're in a 
room full of strangers, friends, or loved ones.</p>

        <p><span class="cap">Lokesh</span>, your archetype also suggests
 that you're often on the lookout for opportunities that don't 
necessarily take you out of the country. As long as there's a new 
experience waiting for you, you're more than willing to give it a shot. 
Whether it's an activity, a sport, or even a new restaurant that you've 
never tried before - you're always game.</p>

        <p>You might not like to admit it, <span class="cap">Lokesh</span>...
 But you're charismatic - at least, more so than the other archetypes. 
This trait of yours stems from your willingness to step out of your 
comfort zone - a trait that's also indicative of your willingness to 
look silly. And there is nothing more charismatic than someone who 
possesses that amount of self-confidence.</p>

        <p>The Explorer archetype, <span class="cap">Lokesh</span>, is 
also one that strives to be different. You prefer to feel and immerse 
yourself in the most foreign environments - environments that the other 
archetypes would prefer to avoid. There's also a side of you that tends 
to be a little bit of an adrenaline junkie - it might not be all that 
obvious, but it definitely exists.</p>

        <p>You're an individual who's sociable, likeable, and 
approachable. Unlike the archetypes who are more introverted by nature, 
any day that you spend sitting around at home feels like a waste of your
 time. You'd very much prefer to be literally anywhere else, doing 
anything else, instead of being cooped up and alone.</p>

        <p>You might not be aware of this, <span class="cap">Lokesh</span>...
 But your willingness to try new things is inspiring and encouraging to 
the people around you - mostly your peers. And because of this, your 
archetype truly has the capacity to achieve greatness.</p>

        <p>That's why the world needs more people like you, <span class="cap">Lokesh</span>... I have no doubt that you will one day uncover ground-breaking discoveries, and contribute great things to the world.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header">As An Explorer, These Are Your Hidden Strengths, Unknown Tendencies, And Positive Attributes That You Wouldn't Expect...</h2>

        <p><span class="cap">Lokesh</span>, despite often being the 
center of attention, your incessant curiosity about others makes you an 
individual who's self-aware and emotionally connected to others. That's 
because even though people are more than willing to listen to the 
stories that you share and the images that you portray, you always know 
when it's time to shift the limelight to someone else. And that 
realization is often driven by you wanting to know the stories of 
others.</p>

        <p>All of that gives rise to the one single attribute that truly
 resembles the Explorer archetype - your obsession with experience - an 
obsession that drives you to learn, to discover, and to explore.</p>

        <p>There's something else about your archetype, <span class="cap">Lokesh</span>...
 And you might or might not agree with this... Your archetype, because 
of your worldly knowledge and self-motivated curiosity, possesses a deep
 understanding of human nature and culture. You're likely to be someone 
who reads people rather well. You know who you can trust, and who you 
must avoid at all costs. </p>

        <p>Although, there are times when compassion takes control over your tendencies, <span class="cap">Lokesh</span>... And that's when you become vulnerable to having your trust misplaced and taken advantage of.</p>

        <!--Insert Strength Image-->
        <img class="img-intext" src="Individualogist.com%20|%20Reading_files/strength.png">

        <p>Based on those attributes, <span class="cap">Lokesh</span>, 
it's evident that you'll experience the greatest amount of fulfillment 
and joy from pursuing a career that will feed your curiosity, take you 
outside of the typical confinements of a desk space, and constantly keep
 you on your toes... Perhaps something outdoors-ish or travel-related.</p>

        <p>Beyond that, <span class="cap">Lokesh</span>, you're also 
someone who's open-minded. You're very accepting of people who come from
 different backgrounds. Your experience with foreign cultures and 
environments has exposed you to a variety of circumstances and 
perspectives, and you're always reminding yourself to be respectful of 
that.</p>

        <p>That's also because you tend to enjoy things that are a bit 
out of the ordinary and venturing out into the unknown - things that 
individuals belonging to other archetypes would prefer to avoid.</p>

        <p>You see, <span class="cap">Lokesh</span> - you have a rather valiant aura, and a daring approach. You're not one to follow in the footsteps of others, are you, <span class="cap">Lokesh</span>.
 Instead, you're the one who paves the way forward - bashing through the
 bushes like the gallant discoverer that you are. After all, you have to
 be a little bit bold in other to explore the unexplored, wouldn't you 
agree, <span class="cap">Lokesh</span>?</p>
        
        <p>But there are obstacles that stand before you... Obstacles that you must be made aware of...</p>

    </div>
        
    <div id="cont-reading" style="display: block;">

        <h2 class="sub-header">Unfortunately, Not All Is Smooth-Sailing For The Adventurous Explorer, <span class="cap">Lokesh</span>... These Are The Shortcomings You Must Look Out For.</h2>

        <p>This portion of your Archetypal Introduction does not seek to scare you, <span class="cap">Lokesh</span>...
 But it's best that you be made aware of the potential challenges that 
lie ahead of you - or perhaps you've encountered some of these 
challenges already.</p>

        <img class="img-intext" src="Individualogist.com%20|%20Reading_files/sailing.png">

        <p>However, I have no doubt that with your strengths, resilience, and fortitude, you will overcome all that stands in your way, <span class="cap">Lokesh</span>.</p>

        <p>You see, <span class="cap">Lokesh</span>, despite your brave 
frontier, there are fears that reside within your archetype... 
Deep-seated fears that appear miniscule to others, but appear menacing 
to you.</p>

        <p>Your archetype tends to be fearful of commitment, and even anything that resembles it. <span class="cap">Lokesh</span>...
 It's  likely that at a certain point in your life, you found the idea 
of marriage a little bit alien - an idea that just never made sense to 
you. That attribute stems from your fear of commitment; commitment of 
any sort... Whether it's residing in a single place for too long, or 
remaining in a relationship with one, single person for eternity.</p>

        <p>Of course, there's nothing wrong with being alone, <span class="cap">Lokesh</span>...
 But that fear originates from your obsession with new experiences - an 
obsession that often leads you to neglect the people closest to you.</p>

        <p>Don't let that discourage you, <span class="cap">Lokesh</span>. As long as you're watchful over how your actions affect others, you will be able to avoid making that mistake.</p>

        <p>As an Explorer, <span class="cap">Lokesh</span>, you have the
 tendency to be a little too critical about yourself - constantly 
pushing yourself to achieve new heights, gain new experiences, and 
explore everywhere that you've never been before. But, at the same time,
 you must understand that growth takes time. You might not have all the 
time in the world, <span class="cap">Lokesh</span>, but it is paramount for you to exercise patience in order not to wear yourself out.</p>

        <p><span class="cap">Lokesh</span>, advancement and growth are 
products of both time and effort, and when you implement that to become a
 part of your life, your passage to fulfillment will be revealed to 
you... All in due time.</p>

        <p>There's something else you need to be aware of, <span class="cap">Lokesh</span>.</p>

        <p>In spite of your magnetic personality, you tend to prefer 
working on your own - and that trait in itself sets boundaries that can 
prevent you from achieving greater things. It is vital for you to learn 
to trust others, and by doing so, you will find that there's a lot more 
for you to gain than to lose.</p>

        <p>To maximize the abilities of your archetype, <span class="cap">Lokesh</span>,
 you must always be trusting, always be humble, and always be giving. 
Those are the qualities and lessons that will lead you to your eventual 
success.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header"><span class="cap">Lokesh</span>, As An Explorer, This Is Your Calling... And It's Beyond Your Wildest Imaginations</h2>

        <p><span class="cap">Lokesh</span>, you are practically a 
chameleon – possessing the uncanny ability to make yourself at home 
within any social group, or social setting; no matter how foreign. Your 
charisma and eloquence intrigues people. And at times, it also earns 
their trust.</p>

        <p>Based on your archetype, it's apparent that you have a strong sense of ambition - a sense of hunger to do greater things.</p>

        <p>However, as mentioned earlier in this Archetypal 
Introduction, your struggle with commitment tends to hold you back. You 
tend to associate commitment with the feeling of being trapped and 
having your freedom stripped away from you... But that feeling could not
 be further from the truth, <span class="cap">Lokesh</span>. Fulfilment,
 at its essence, is derived from forging valuable relationships – with 
others, and yourself. And that, in itself, requires commitment.</p>

        <p>And that's where your calling resides, <span class="cap">Lokesh</span>.
 You want to live life for yourself, without appearing selfish. You want
 to love yourself, while keeping the relationships you’ve forged close 
to your heart. Your archetype is the role model and catalyst of change, 
with exploration as its backbone.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header"><span class="cap">Lokesh</span>, Here's A Glimpse Into Your Love Compatibility With Other Archetypes...</h2>

        <img class="love-img" src="Individualogist.com%20|%20Reading_files/explorer-love-compatibility.png">

        <p><span class="cap">Lokesh</span>, do you see that chart on 
top? That little chart over there represents the archetypes that you’re 
most likely to end up with. Or if you’re already in a committed 
relationship, there’s a really good chance that your spouse is one of 
those archetypes.</p>

        <p><span class="cap">Lokesh</span>, your love compatibility 
profile is extraordinarily different from the other archetypes - and I'm
 sure some of your exes or current partner will agree with me on this.</p>

        <p>It's difficult to describe, but this is the most apt way of 
putting it. Based on the nature of your archetype, you tend to be an 
excellent short-term lover, but you might find it difficult to be a 
long-term partner.</p>

        <p>Your relationships and romances are often short-lived. Even 
if the connection between you and your romantic partner appears strong, 
you always seem to have one foot out the door.</p>

        <p>Because of that, it can be challenging for you to meet the 
right one. However, don't be disheartened. Whether or not you're already
 in a committed relationship, you'll be just fine.</p>

        <p>And when, or if you already have, met the right one, you must
 be weary of temptations - committing yourself completely can be scary 
and hard... But with a disciplined mind and a dedicated heart, you will 
overcome that fear and produce a fruitful and loving relationship.</p>

        <p>In the presence of your partner, depending on your level of 
comfort, you tend to be slightly more reserved than usual... Perhaps 
that stems from your struggle with trust. However, you must remember 
that it's trust that will allow your archetype to open up.</p>

        <p>But don’t forget, <span class="cap">Lokesh</span>, how you 
perceive yourself should not be determined by your love life. Romance is
 merely one, single aspect of life - not the only. It's always best to 
focus on your own personal growth, because that's the path that you must
 embark on to lead a rewarding and fulfilled life.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header">There Seems To Be Just One Thing Holding You Back From Experiencing Overflowing Abundance...</h2>
      
        <p>Now, Lokesh, there's something really exciting that I'd like 
to share with you - something that I really think is going to interest 
you, and set you on the path of happiness and abundance. But before we 
get into that, it's important that we understand why you haven't 
experienced a true transformation in your life... And more importantly, 
why you've yet to attract abundance.</p>
      
        <p>Based on the habits and behavioural responses of your 
archetype, Lokesh, it's highly likely that you're someone who struggles 
with confidence...</p>
      
        <p>At times, it feels like there's some sort of a glass ceiling 
hovering above your head... And it's blocking you from achieving of your
 dreams of enormous success. Wouldn't you agree?</p>
            
        <p>You tend to waiver when it comes to making difficult 
decisions. You feel uncertain and unsure, and more often than not, you 
look towards others for approval and reassurance.</p>
            
        <p>This clouds your instincts and clarity, leading to 
unfavourable outcomes and dire consequences for you... Perhaps in the 
form of negative energies, energy blockages, and imbalances in your 
archetype.</p>
      
        <p>Think of all the missed opportunities that you could have 
seized for yourself... All the abundance you could have experienced, if 
only you had the foresight and confidence to take a leap of faith, to 
make something happen.</p>
      
        <p>This tends to happen when you lack guidance and a strong flair for your true purpose.</p>
            
        <p>But it is NOT too late to make a change, Lokesh. In fact, your timing could not have been BETTER.</p>
      
        <p>Right at this very moment, you have all the tools you need to
 make an enormous change in your life. When you really think about it, 
every decision that you've ever made in your life has led you to this 
exact moment...</p>
      
        <p>...This is NOT a coincidence. You deserve to experience the 
true meaning of joy and overflowing abundance. You deserve to uncover 
your true purpose, and your true identity in this lifetime.</p>
      
        <h2 class="sub-header">Before we end this miniature reading, 
Lokesh, I wanted to let you know that there's so much left to explore in
 your Archetypal Profile...</h2>

        <p>...After all, we've yet to look into your Shadow, your Anima/Animus, your Ego, and your Life Path.</p>

        <p>Your Shadow is the suppressed side of your personality. The 
dark, hidden side of who you are - where all of your innate tendencies, 
thoughts, and desires reside...</p>

        <p>Your Anima/Animus is the imbalance between masculinity and femininity in your personality.</p>

        <p>Your Ego is the centre of your consciousness - the part of you that needs to be controlled in order to discover your True Self.</p>

        <p>As you can already tell, there's so much more to explore in your archetype, Lokesh!</p>

        <p>And YES, you CAN gain insight into EVERY little piece of the puzzle that forms the entirety of your personality.</p>

        <p>That includes...</p>

        <ul>
            <li>The reasons behind the choices that you've made in your life</li>
            <li>A complete and unquestionable understanding of who you are, and who you were meant to be</li>
            <li>An honest and open encounter with your biggest struggles and weaknesses</li>
            <li>Insights into your concealed strengths, and how you can leverage on them to gain everything you've ever wanted</li>
            <li>The perfect life partner or campanion based on your personality traits</li>
            <li>The quickest path that you can take to attain extraordinary success</li>
            <li>Foresight into the potential challenges that you have to overcome</li>
            <li>Your personal path towards unlocking a rewarding life built around fulfillment</li>
            <li>A remarkable breakthrough across all aspects of your life...</li>

        <p>Or perhaps it could simply be a sense of inner peace - being 
able to defeat the monsters that plague your soul, and warding off all 
negative energies that seem to be hindering you.</p>
        
        <p>Think of your heart's DEEPEST desires... And think about them very carefully.</p>

        <p>Now, here's the good news, Lokesh. As soon as you're equipped
 with this self-discovery tool, whatever your soul yearns for will be 
bestowed upon you... I'm absolutely sure of it, and here's why...</p> 
        
        <p>With your Premium Archetypal Analysis, Lokesh, you'll discover two important revelations...</p>

        <p>The first revelation you'll discover is what you really want 
in this lifetime - based on the configurations and tendencies of your 
archetype. In other words, your truest desires.</p>

        <p>It sounds easy enough to figure out, doesn't it? But the truth is, it's often the direct opposite of what you'd expect, Lokesh.</p>

        <p>And no, it's not going to be about something that you can achieve in the physical world... </p>

        <p>Instead, it's something you can only achieve within the domain of your own spiritual and psychological senses.</p>

        <p>Now, the second thing you'll discover is your path to a fulfilling and rewarding life.</p>

        <p>And no, this has nothing to do with fame and fortune. That's 
the beauty of Archetypes... As you can already tell, this is a journey 
that's far more profound than that.</p>

        <p>The answers to all of your life’s questions, to all of your 
life’s complications, to all of your life’s encounters, failures, and 
successes, can be found within your Premium Archetypal Analysis...</p>

        <p>If you’re unsure of the path that you’re currently on, your 
Premium Archetypal Analysis will be there to help you navigate your way 
towards your goals and ambitions.</p>

        <p>If you’re wondering whether your actions are right or wrong, this analysis will grant you unquestionable direction.</p>

        <p>If the people around you are holding you back, this report will give you all clarity you need.</p>

        <!--Insert Joy Image-->
        <img class="img-intext" src="Individualogist.com%20|%20Reading_files/joy.png">

        <p>All of that information is readily available for you... And it can all be found in your Premium Archetypal Analysis</p>

        <p>The insights within it will give you the answers you need to make better decisions and embark on your true journey.</p> 
        
        <p>All of this... Everything I've just mentioned, WILL be handed to you on a silver platter.</p>

        <p>Lokesh, this is a journey that I'm more than happy to guide 
you through... But we can't move forward unless you take the first step.</p>

        <p>...Are you constantly worrying about your financial situation?</p>
        <p>...Are you constantly thinking about where you're going in life?</p>
        <p>...Are you constantly pondering about whether your love life isn't as great as it you think it is?</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header">Now, Tell Me This, Lokesh... Are You Eager To Take Back The Reigns And Choose Your Own Destiny?</h2>

        <p>Yes, I can see the eagerness that burns within you... </p>

        <p>You see, your Premium Archetypal Analysis is the exact tool that you've been searching for.</p>

        <p>That's because the Premium Archetypal Analysis is based on the process of Individuation... </p>

        <p>A process that's taken THOUSANDS of years of in-depth analysis, and painstaking research.</p>

        <p>A process that has been used, implemented, and improved by 
famous philosophers and psychologists... From the Renaissance, to the 
Middle Ages, dating all the way back to the days of Ancient Greece!</p>
        
        <p>I'm talking about the likes of renowned psychologist Dr. Carl
 Jung... Legendary philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle. These are 
just some of the popular names behind the concept of archetypes, Lokesh!</p>

        <p>But that's not all, Lokesh...</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header">The Premium Archetypal Analysis is the only one of its kind in terms of ACCURACY and VALUE.</h2>
      
        <p>And unlike other readings, your Premium Archetypal Analysis 
is not a concoction of general traits and generic information - it's so,
 so much more. Your personality profile is merely just ONE, single 
factor of your archetype...</p>
      
        <p>Your Premium Archetypal Analysis will introduce you to the 
process of individuation - a spiritual and psychological process that 
will help you understand your path and purpose at a heightened state.</p>
      
        <p>It will help you understand the role you will excel in and 
the journey - the Odyssey, that you must embark on to attain the rewards
 in life that you seek.</p>
      
        <p>It will guide you through an in-depth understanding of what 
your archetype truly encompasses, its Incarnations, to help you gain a 
newfound perspective of who you truly are, and who you will eventually 
become.</p>
      
        <p>Your Premium Archetypal Analysis is more than just an 
analysis, Lokesh... It is your spiritual guide and compass - one which 
you will use to navigate the rest of your life with FLAWLESS precision.</p>

        <p>Not many of us are lucky enough to have experienced the joy 
of knowing your true identity, but that’s what your Premium Archetypal 
Analysis is going to find for you.</p>

        <img class="img-intext" src="Individualogist.com%20|%20Reading_files/paa-cover.png">

        <p>Today, you’ve stumbled upon a rare opportunity, Lokesh... An 
opportunity for you to completely change your life. This might be the 
only time life hands you a reset button.

        </p><p>This is your one chance to come face-to-face with your archetype and be guided through a transformational journey.

        </p><p>This is your time to shine and make the decision that will align your direction with your destiny.</p>
                  
        <ul>
            <li>Your Analysis will show you the exact steps you need to 
take to experience a breakthrough in ALL aspects of your life - your 
career, your relationships, and your sense of purpose.</li>
            <li>It will help you make sense of everything that's 
happened in your life - the points in your life that altered your 
original course of direction.</li>
            <li>It will open your heart and mind to a newfound sense of inner strength to charge through mental barriers and limiting beliefs.</li>
            <li>It will release your intuitive instinct and grant you purpose in all aspects of your life.</li>
            <li>It will help you recognize potential challenges that lie
 ahead of you, and give you all the information you need to avoid them 
completely.</li>
            <li>And by the end of this journey, you will be overflowing with joy, abundance, and purpose.</li>
            <li>Your Premium Archetypal Analysis will be UNLIKE anything
 anyone has ever told you about yourself - in fact, you will be SHOCKED 
at how true, yet different it is.</li>
            <li>You will receive a complete and detailed reading, broken
 down into 5 different components - your Individuation Fundamentals, 
your Archetypal Profile, your Archetypal Incarnations, your Archetypal 
Odyssey, and your Archetypal Exercise Guide.</li>
            <li>And on top of that, you will also receive your 3 
additional bonus readings for FREE - readings that will help you obtain a
 deeper understanding of the metaphysical realm... Information that you 
can use to enhance your understand of archetypes.</li>
        </ul>
                
        <p>Do NOT wait a second longer. Like all things in life, this 
opportunity too will not be here forever. In fact, there's no guarantee 
that it will even continue to exist within the next HOUR.</p>
        
        <p>The true difference between greatness and mediocrity lies in 
DECISIVENESS. Every minute that passes is another minute longer you have
 to wait before achieving your abundant state.</p> 
        
        <p>And if you could only see a FRACTION OF THE POTENTIAL that I 
see within your archetype, Lokesh, you would not wait a SECOND longer. 
You DESERVE to experience your phenomenal breakthrough. You DESERVE to 
experience joy, happiness, and purpose.</p>
        
        <p>It would be a complete and utter shame if you missed yet 
another golden opportunity at your transformation... Simply because you 
allowed indecision to take control.</p>
        
        <p>Once again, as soon as you embark on this journey, you will 
instantly receive your Premium Archetypal Analysis, your 3 FREE 
complementary bonuses, all of which is protected by our 60-Day 
Money-Back Guarantee..</p>
        
        <p>And in order to help you save on shipping and ensure that you
 receive everything INSTANTLY, you will receive everything in digital 
formats - so you'll never have to wait for it, and you'll never have to 
worry about misplacing it.</p>
        
        <p>But you have to move forward with this right now... The 
moment you say no to this, your opportunity to experience massive 
growth, joy, satisfaction, and direction would have been lost...</p> 
        
        <p>Your current path of uncertainty will come to a screeching 
halt the SECOND you proceed. And by this time tomorrow, you will witness
 your life transform before your very eyes in spectacular fashion.</p>
        
        <p>This will be the single best decision that you've ever made, 
Lokesh... Because for once in your life, your joy, your success, and 
your life's purpose will all be within your hands.</p>

        <p>Listen to your intuition, and move forward with this 
risk-free opportunity now - before it's no longer available! The second 
you click on the button below, you'll be one step closer to witnessing

    <div class="panel">
      <p>If you're reading this answer, you're probably wondering about 
my experience and whether I'm actually able to help you. You already 
know my name, now let me tell you about my experience. Naturally, your 
analysis is in good hands. I have practiced Individuation and Archetypal
 Indentification for approximately 17 years as of 2018. In fact, I'm 
proud to say that my work has helped thousands of struggling and lost 
individuals find their true selves - all by encountering their 
archetypes. Individuals who have encountered circumstances similar to 
yours - and more often than not, circumstances far more dire.</p>

      <p>My experience with working with archetypes has also opened my 
eyes to my own, personal direction - which is to reach out and help as 
many struggling individuals as possible. It is my life's calling, and 
one that grants me fulfillment and infinite joy! I'm more than happy to 
grant you these life-changing insights in the form of your analysis, but
 it is paramount that you approach your analysis with an open mind, a 
willing heart, and an eager attitude. With these traits in place, I have
 no doubt that you will experience the transformations and wonderful 
experiences that Individuation has to offer!</p>
   </div>   
    
  <button class="accordion">Why should I buy from Individualogist?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>You could probably find a book about Individuation from a local
 book store, which will contain a chapter or a couple of pages about 
your archetype. But that single chapter or two pages isn’t going to be 
very helpful. So, here’s the truth.</p>

      <p>The Premium Archetypal Analysis is an excruciatingly detailed 
report about your archetype, containing  highly informative pages of 
actionable and thought-provoking strategies and methodologies. Once 
again, all of the information is customized to your specific archetype. 
It breaks down an in-depth outlook of your life journey and all of its 
obstacles. There is no other product that comes as close in terms of 
detail or information.</p>

      <p>The Premium Archetypal Analysis is 100% owned and authored by 
us. This is the only place where you’re able to get it, or anything like
 it.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">I've tried similar products before that didn't help. Why will this time be any different?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Other products assume that everyone functions and processes 
information in the same way. The law of attraction assumes that everyone
 is built with the same framework. Manifestation programs assume that 
everyone will respond the same way. Meditation methods assume that 
everyone experiences calmness similarly.</p>

        <p>That is utter nonsense. We are all different individuals. We 
each have different fears, different circumstances, and different life 
experiences. Individuation and archetypes take that into account. Our 
readings are specifically catered to your archetype to provide you with 
actionable steps that you can take towards making a true change in your 
life. It reveals callings and directions that are specific to you.</p>

        <p>That’s why it’s going to work. This product seeks to bring 
the term “personal” back into personal development; an industry littered
 with impersonal products that have strayed away from what personal 
development was meant to be.</p>
      </div>

    <button class="accordion">Is the Premium Archetypal Analysis really proven by Science?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Absolutely. Individuation is a psychological process that was
 created by thought leaders in the psychological world decades ago. In 
fact, principles of Individuation can be traced all the way back to the 
days of Aristotle.</p>

        <p>This means that Individuation has stood the test of time to 
be a proven personal development process. There have also been numerous 
conclusive scientific studies about analytical psychology (what 
Individuation is based on) across the globe.</p>
      </div>

    <button class="accordion">What if it doesn't work for me?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>If you find that the teachings are not helpful to you, the 
first thing you should do is contact us at contact@individualogist.com. 
We will guide you through the Individuation process and explain to you 
your archetype in even greater detail. It is important that you employ 
the strategies and methods taught in the reading for approximately 28 
days (1 month) before deciding that it isn’t for you.</p>

        <p>Of course, if you insist that this isn’t something helpful to
 you, we have a 60 day refund policy. This allows you to refund your 
purchase to get back 100% of your money within 60 days. So, we take all 
the risk, and you take none of it. It is extremely important to us that 
you get as much value as you can from our product.</p>
      </div>

    <button class="accordion">What do I do about the materials from other similar programs?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>The wonderful thing about the Premium Archetypal Analysis is 
that it can be applied in conjunction with virtually everything else 
that’s personal development related. This includes numerology, 
astrology, manifestation, meditation, tarot reading, the law of 
attraction, and practically every other program on the market.</p>

        <p>Individuation seeks to holistically enhance your personal 
development growth, and accelerate your journey. It does not work 
against other programs, but works together with them.</p>
